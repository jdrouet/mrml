# MRML

The MRML repository is moving to the `jolimail` organisation and splitting from a monorepo to smaller repositories.

You can now find `mrml-core` [here](https://github.com/jolimail/mrml-core) and `mrml-cli` [here](https://github.com/jolimail/mrml-cli). The others are coming soon. Will keep this repository as a "monorepo" using submodules for some time.
